# cadquery-x
A project to work through some purely experimental ideas for the CadQuery project.

***This project is no longer maintained. What I was attempting to do here is being replaced by [cadquery-gui](https://github.com/jmwright/cadquery-gui) and the [CadQuery 2.0](https://github.com/dcowden/cadquery/tree/2_0_branch) branch. Please follow those projects if you are 
interested in a PythonOCC/OCE version of CadQuery and the next generation GUI.***
